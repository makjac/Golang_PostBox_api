# introduction

### Topic

This project is for a fictional courier company called *PostBox*, which offers delivery services through automated parcel machines. The concept is inspired by the real-world *InPost* company.

The application is designed specifically for customers, enabling them to:

- Create or log into their account,
- Order packages,
- View a list of incoming and shipped packages,
- Track the history of selected packages,
- View and edit user profile.

### Architecture

The project consists of the following components:

- A PostgreSQL database for data storage,
- An API built in Golang, using the Gin-Gonic framework and Go-PG package,
- A user interface developed with Dart and the Flutter framework.

The application server is hosted on Google Cloud Platform, and email services are managed through the Mailjet platform.
